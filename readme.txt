A short description of the mod's content:
- Remake/artistic rework of WoG add-on graphics (objects on the adventure map, interface, modified unit sprites, etc.), fixes for graphical flaws in both WoG and the original game
- Addition of over 500 new objects to the game, available in random map generation and in the map editor
- Fixes for the graphics of the original game, ported from HotA
- Return of static object flags and static trees on the adventure map
- Correction and improvement of decorative object generation on random maps. Green trees will not appear on Snow, rocky mountains will not be able to appear on Dirt, and other fixes that contribute to the most artistically high-quality decor generation
